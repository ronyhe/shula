# Shula

Shula is an electron based minesweeper game.
Its goal is to become an official minesweeper clone for http://www.minesweeper.info/
The project is in its infancy, and the goal is still far away, but it's worth noting anyway.

In fact the goal is a bit more ambitious:
Become the first official minesweeper that is both cross platform and open source.
Another, more minor goal is having accessible code.
This will aid in finding and removing exploits and will help the minesweeper community make informed decisions.
This goal is basically a requirement for being open source software, but it's worth mentioning anyway.

## Technology

To achieve these goals I chose the electron application framework.
It enables writing desktop apps using HTML+CSS+JS which are very prevalent in the software world. This will enable
many developers to understand and take part in the project.

## Naming
Shula is a dumb joke about how the minesweeper game is called in Hebrew, "Shole Mokshim".
The first word is spelled the same as the common Hebrew name, Shula, which is how many 
Hebrew speakers refer to the game.

## Next steps
- Add basic configurations (board sizes etc)
- Add stats
- Add recordings and playback
- Add different board sizes
- Provide complete, setup-less executables for Windows, OSX and popular linux distros.
